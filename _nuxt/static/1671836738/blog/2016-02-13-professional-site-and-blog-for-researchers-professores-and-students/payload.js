If you google your full name,\nchances are you're gonna find some information about you. Possibly a Facebook or\nother social media page.\nMaybe an old blog, that you forgot to delete.\nPossibly things you didn't even know were online, like public documents with\nyour name, or aggregator sites with your information.\nMost of all, you'll probably find things that aren't you.\n\nSuppose someone is trying to find you, but they know only your name, and\npossibly occupation. Could they?\nFurthermore, could they contact you?\nDo you have enough information for they to discern if it is really you?\nDo they have to contact you to see your area of expertise? Your projects?\nFor that end, it is usually a good idea to store some information about youself\nin a webpage mantained by yourself.\n\nI'll will show an example of web page management that takes little effort, and\nyou can use for a personal page and\u002For a blog.\n\n### General Information\n\nThe name of the game is\n[Jekyll](https:\u002F\u002Fjekyllrb.com\u002F). This software mantains web pages using\ntemplates, page snippets, and a little programming to make your job easier.\nIf you enter [this blog](http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fabelsiqueira\u002Fblog), you'll see what\nit looks like.\n\nThe most important folder is `_posts`. This is where you write your posts. The\nnaming follows the format `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-the-post.ext`, and you begin the\nfile with a little header like\n\n```\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle:  Professional site and blog for researchers, professors and students\ndate:   2016-02-13\nname:   2016-02-13-professional-site-and-blog-for-researchers-professores-and-students\n---\n```\n\nand then you can write the content.\nOn a clean project, just creating a new file like this is enough for you to have\na new blog post, but now you want to make it look good.\nTo create a page that is not a post, like my `about` page, you can simply create\na file inside the folder, create a similar header, and write the page. See my\nown\n[about.md](https:\u002F\u002Fraw.githubusercontent.com\u002Fabelsiqueira{{local_prefix}}gh-pages\u002Fabout.md).\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is the `layout` part. In the folder `_layouts`\nthere are some templates for a site. For instance, the \"default\" layout is an\nhtml documeent that includes a head.html, then a header.html, then the content,\nthen a footer.html. These included files reside in the folder `_includes`.\n\nNotice that the content is written between\n`{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}`. This is the language\nthat Jekyll interprets to generate the site. This between\n`{% raw %}{%{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}%}{% endraw %}` are for\ncommands, and between\n`{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}` are for variable input.\nFor instance, to print the current page's title somewhere in your text, you may\nuse `{% raw %}{{ page.title }}{% endraw %}`. Not very useful so far, but if want\nto put a list of posts in a page you may use\n\n```\n{% raw %}{% for pt in site.posts %}\n  - {{ pt.date }}: {{ pt.title }}\n{% endfor %}{% endraw %}\n```\n\nThis is only a simple example, and you'll probably want to improve your list to\nyour liking.\nIn addition, you can play around with conditionals and filters. For instance,\nthe navigation bar on my work site is a list of all pages with a title, of the\nsame language of the one you're in, ordered by an internal value.\n\nTo create a clean site and test these fun things, first install Jekyll (follow\nthe instructions on the site for your system), and then issue the commands in\nthe terminal\n\n```\njekyll new mysite\ncd mysite\njekyll serve -w\n```\n\nYour site will be built and available at\n[localhost:4000](http:\u002F\u002Flocalhost:4000).\nTo get the site to look good, however, you'll need to edit a few things, like\nthe layouts for your liking, the css, and so on.\nTo avoid doing that, you can use my own site as a starting point. I show you how\nin the next section.\n\n### Using my site as a starting point\n\nFirst, let's create a work page. If you don't want one, then jump to the blog\npart.\nAlso, if you know git, and are familiar with GitHub, you can jump a few steps.\n\n#### Work page - Easy way\n\n- Create a [GitHub](http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com) account.\n- Go to [my github page](http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fabelsiqueira\u002Fabelsiqueira.github.io).\n- Fork the page, finding the button that says fork and clicking on it.\n- In your page, with name http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fyouruser\u002Fabelsiqueira.github.io, go to\n\n```\nsettings, and rename the repository to `youruser.github.io`.\n```\n\n- Edit the file `_config.yml` and change all pertinent information. Don't leave\n  anything with my user.\n  **You can edit and create files directly on GitHub, but you can't preview\n  your site before publishing. To edit, click on edit, make your modifications\n  and then on the bottom of the page click on commit. To create, click on the +\n  button, and do similar steps.**\n\nThis is sufficient for a site to appear on `http:\u002F\u002Fyouruser.github.io` in at\nmost a few minutes. Now you only need to edit to your liking.\nFor a multilingual support (default), I suggest you create files with the format\n`name.lg.md` where `name` is whatever name you want to give, like `research` and\n`lg` is a language prefix. There is no real need to follow this, but it's\ncleaner.\nThen inside this file, you need to fill\n\n```\n---\nlayout: page\ntitle:  Page Title\nkey:    name\nlang:   lg\norder:  Where you want the page in the navigation bar. Lower if leftmost.\npermalink: \u002Flg\u002Fname\u002F\n---\n```\n\nSee the files `research.br.md` and `research.en.md` for the differences.\n\nIt's very important that pages that are translations for each other to have the\nsame key. Also, for the flag image to appear, you need a file `lg.png` in the\nfolder `assets`.\n\nI keep a folder `disciplinas` for my teaching files. You may erase it.\n\nIf you don't want a blog, you probably want to delete the navigation bar's\n`blog`, which is hardcoded. Go to file `_includes\u002Fheader.html` and find the\nlines with `\u003Ca class=...Blog\u003C\u002Fa\u003E` and delete it.\n\nChange the picture.\n\n#### Work page - Hard way\n\nRead the easy way first, but don't do anything yet.\nDownload my page's source code, either using git or zip.\nModify as you see fit, following the guidelines above.\nTest the page with `jekyll serve -w` as I said before, and build it for\npublishing with `jekyll build`.\nYour page's files will be inside the folder `_site`.\nYou can publish them however you want. If you have a site at your university,\nyou can send these files there (probably). For that, you'll have to check with\nyour IT department.\n\nThe advantage of this is that you don't have to use GitHub (or even git) for\nanything. The disavantage is that you need to install Jekyll, and you won't have\na default site location.\n\n#### Blog page - Easy way\n\n- Create a [GitHub](http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com) account.\n- Go to [my github blog page](http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fabelsiqueira\u002Fblog).\n- Fork the page, finding the button that says fork and clicking on it.\n- Edit the file `_config.yml` and change all pertinent information. Don't leave\n  anything with my user.\n  **You can edit and create files directly on GitHub, but you can't preview\n  your site before publishing. To edit, click on edit, make your modifications\n  and then on the bottom of the page click on commit. To create, click on the +\n  button, and do similar steps.**\n- Edit the `about.md` file to be about you.\n- Delete all posts in `_posts`, except maybe one to use as a beginning point.\n- Write your post.\n\nIf you access `http:\u002F\u002Fyouruser.github.io{{local_prefix}}`, you'll see your blog. Notice\nthat, if you haven't created the work page, `http:\u002F\u002Fyouruser.github.io` won't\nexist, although your blog will.\nAlso, you won't want the `Work` entry on the navigation bar.\nGo to the file `_includes\u002Fheader.html` and modify the line\n`\u003Ca class=\"page-link\" href=\"\u002F\"\u003EWork\u003C\u002Fa\u003E`.\nIf you don't have a work page, then delete it.\nIf you do, you can change the \"\u002F\" to your work page url.\n\n#### Blog page - Hard way\n\nRead everything. Do as in the hard part of the work page.\n\n#### Both - Hard way\n\nIf you want both, when publishing the content of the blog, remember to publish\nthe blog pages to a folder `blog`.\n"},prev:{slug:"2016-02-14-viii-simposio-de-analise-numerica",title:"VIII Simpósio de Análise Numérica e Otimização - Minicurso de Julia"},next:{slug:"2015-11-20-apresentacao-no-poincare---2015",title:"Apresentação no Poincaré - 2015"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("text","element","\n","code","a","p","li","nofollow","noopener","noreferrer","_blank","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link",".","div","nuxt-content-highlight","pre","language-text","line-numbers","h4","ul"," and ","blog",3,"Introduction","General Information","Using my site as a starting point","http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fabelsiqueira\u002Fblog","h3","Professional site and blog for researchers, professors and students","summary","Summary:","introduction","general-information","using-my-site-as-a-starting-point","mine","https:\u002F\u002Fjekyllrb.com\u002F","Jekyll","http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fabelsiqueira\u002Fabelsiqueira.github.io","hr","#introduction","#general-information","#using-my-site-as-a-starting-point","#work-page---easy-way","Work page - Easy way","#work-page---hard-way","Work page - Hard way","#blog-page---easy-way","Blog page - Easy way","#blog-page---hard-way","Blog page - Hard way","#both---hard-way","Both - Hard way","_posts","about.md","{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}","{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}","Create a ","http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com","GitHub"," account.","Go to ","Fork the page, finding the button that says fork and clicking on it.","http:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fyouruser\u002Fabelsiqueira.github.io","Edit the file ","_config.yml"," and change all pertinent information.
