At the Federal University of Paran√°, while I was a professor, I helped create [CiDAMO](https://cidamo.com.br), a data science, machine learning, and optimization group.
We created the group in 2018 (or 2017?) in order to attend to the increasing interest in data science from the students and from ourselves.

We organized a few events and meetups, although COVID really disrupted operations.
In the beginning of 2020 we manage to have an in-person week-long event (called CiDWeek) with over 300 participants, with presentations from companies, professors, and students.
