# Long time away


Hello, it's been a long time since my last post, and a lot has
happened since.
I've had difficulty finding time to write a good post, or even a bad
post, sometimes, but now I return with a brief explaining, and some
possible continuation posts.

First, during the classes period, I have a lot of obligations that use
a lot of time: Preparing classes, tests, projects, grading, etc.
This was most of my time.

Additionally, in May, I went to two conferences in my field, the
Optimization Days 2016, in Montreal, Canada, and the XI Brazilian Workshop on
Continuos Optimization, in Manaus/Amazonas, here in Brazil.
For the first, I left at the end of April, but I had no visa, so I had
to rush to get everything in order, then get the tickets and the
hotel, while preparing the talk. I also worked with Dominique Orban in
there, which you should know from CUTEst.

Furthermore, I also gave a talk about Games and Artificial
Intelligence for undergrad students around April and a talk about
Julia for the Informatics grad program around May.

June was a month of closures. I (re)done an old paper with Francisco
Gomes and submitted it. I almost finished the content of a paper with
Geovani Grapiglia. CUTEst (and related) is (are) almost ready for
release. The classes finished.

This week, the first of July, I had the pleasure of having Miles
Lubin, from MIT, over at UFPR. He gave a tutorial on JuMP, presenting
a linear and a non-linear model. People were very interested, and it
was very popular. There were 28 people attending it, with interest
from the audience and a wide range of fields. I do plan to use JuMP in
future classes, and some colleagues might too.
Also this week, there is a Term Paper defense, and the second part of my
tenure-track avaliation.

Now that I'll have more time again, I'll probably make more posts. I
have one about CUTEst, which I expected to make when released, but
maybe I'll have to do earlier to avoid confusion.
I also want to make more applications of mathematics with Julia, but
let's see what happens.

See you soon.
