# Academic Path

TL;DR:

  - 11/2014-present - Professor at UFPR;
  - 12/2013-11/2014 - Postdoctorate at UNICAMP, improving the work of my doctorate;
  - 01/2009-11/2013 - Doctorate at UNICAMP on the field of Applied Mathematics, working
```
with Nonlinear Optimization. My thesis was "Dynamic Control of Infeasibility
for Nonlinear Programming"
```
  - 03/2005-12/2008 - Bachelor of Applied Mathematics;

Long version:

I began working on mathematics on 2005, entering the course 51 of
[UNICAMP](http://www.unicamp.br), where you study for one and half year the
common classes to Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, and some other
courses. Initially I planned to follow Pure Mathematics, but after my first
programming class, I considerer changing to some area of Computations. The
following semester I studied Numerical Calculus, which led me to the path of
Applied Mathematics. This felling was reforced by Numerical Analysis and
Nonlinear Programming, and I soon decided to follow the academic path.

In 2007, I started a Scientific Initiation with my advisor and good friend
[Francisco de Assis Magalh√£es Gomes Neto](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~chico),
entitled "Interior Point Methods for Quadratic Programming".
My reason for choosing Chico, as he is commonly known, was that he was from the
Nonlinear Optimization area and had previously worked with C++, which I intended
to learn. The work was completed by 2008.

In 2008, having interest in the academic path, I decided to "rush" some
teaching of the post-graduate level. I rushed two in the first semester, and
one in the second. The teaching rushed were "Matrices", which is a discipline
about theoretical properties of matrices, norms, eigenvalues, linear systems,
and decompositions, with some algorithmic considerations, but no programming.
The other was "Numerical Methods for Linear Algebra", which is basically the
programming part of "Matrices". This was my first contact with FORTRAN, which
was awful. The last discipline was "Topics of Numerical Analysis", which in this
case was about finite differences. I finished my graduation on december of this
year.

In 2009, I started my Doctorate on Applied Mathematics, also on UNICAMP, in the
work "Dynamic Control of Infeasibility for Nonlinear Programming". During the
doctorate, I studied Linear Programming, Nonlinear Optimization and
Derivative-Free Optimization. On December, 2013, I finished my doctorate.

On December, 2013, I started my post-doctorate, following the work of my
doctorate. On March, 2014, I participated on the selection process to work on
UFPR, and was approved at third position. I was called to work on November,
2014;
