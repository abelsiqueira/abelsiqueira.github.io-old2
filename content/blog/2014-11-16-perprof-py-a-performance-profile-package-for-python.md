# perprof-py&#58 A Performance Profile Package for Python

One of the things I worked with was a Performance Profile tool, in the sense
of Dolan and Mor√©. This tool,
[perprof-py](http://ufpr-opt.github.io/perprof-py), written in Python,
reads input in the form of a table of problem with time and exitflag, and
outputs a image/pdf with the performance profile.
This tool is very important for the nonlinear optimization community, since it
is one of the main comparison tools for the algorithms.

The package is open source, available for changes, improvements and suggestions.
Many options have been implemented to costumize the graphic, or to improve the
input of data. The source is available at
[github](http://github.com/ufpr-opt/perprof-py).
