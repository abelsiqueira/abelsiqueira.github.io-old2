# Julia Fractal on Julia


I wanted a background that would update automatically in some
interesting way, instead of just random images.
After some thought, I decided to use some [Julia
fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).

I made a code to create the Julia fractals in the [Julia
language](https://julialang.org), and then some code to run it for a random
point.

The code is [here](https://github.com/abelsiqueira/juliabg), including some
explaining on how to use and install it.

Here are some examples:
