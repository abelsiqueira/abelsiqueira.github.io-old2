# New computer at work

I just got a new notebook at work. This is a HP computer, with a AMD a10-4600M
processor, 4GB of RAM and 320GB of HD space.
I have a personal notebook with a similar configuration and my work desktop also
has a similar configuration, so this isn't a great improvement.
However, we're gonna have an additional monitor, so this is good enough.
Also, I'll leave the other one as the always-on screen+irssi computer.
Let's try to use it. Talk to me again in a week.

I'll leave a list of commands I used to install Archlinux on it for future
reference. Maybe someday I'll comment it, but most things here can be found on
[the beginners' guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide).

```
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
ip link set enp1s0 down
netctl start MYCONFIGURATION

(parted) mkpart primary linux-swap 30GiB 38GiB
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 38GiB 100%
(parted) quit
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
mkswap /dev/sda3
swapon /dev/sda3
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home}
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home
cd /etc/pacman.d
cp mirrorlist{,.bk}
#grep Brazil -A 1 mirrorlist.bk | sed '/--/d' > mirrorlist

cp /etc/netctl/ufpr-static /mnt/etc/netctl/ufpr-static
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

```
netctl start ufpr-static
pacman -S xorg-server i3-wm i3lock i3status xorg-xinit xorg-twm xterm dmenu
pacman -S xf86-input-synaptics
useradd abel -g users -G wheel -m -s /bin/bash

# Log as abel

# Download b43-firmware and install it
# Rejoice
```
