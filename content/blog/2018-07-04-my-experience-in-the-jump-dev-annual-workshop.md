# My experience in the JuMP-dev annual workshop

Last week I had the pleasure of being invited to the [Second annual JuMP-dev
workshop](http://www.juliaopt.org/meetings/bordeaux2018/), which happened in June 27-29,
2018 at Bordeaux, France.
I've presented the packages from the [Julia Smooth
Optimizers](https://JuliaSmoothOptimizers.github.io) organization, and had a very good
time meeting with the JuMP developers.

For those still unaware, [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) is a modelling
language for Mathematical Programming written in Julia. It provides access to a few
different solvers for many kinds of problems, and it works inside of Julia, so one can
enjoy the advantages of having a robust language if there is a need for advanced usage.

I've used Julia in classes since 2016 for teaching numerical calculus, and the packages
of Julia Smooth Optimizers for nonlinear optimization this last semester.
I've taught a quick tutorial on JuMP in that class to solve a few nonlinear problems,
and discuss the starting point dependency of nonlinear solvers.
The notebook can be found [here](https://abelsiqueira.github.io/cm106-2018s1/) in
portuguese.
